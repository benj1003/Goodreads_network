		<p>One way to answer this question is to look at books that other readers of your greatest 
			book ever also read. But how are books related and recommended with each other? This 
			is what we have investigated!</p>
		<p>By creating a network of books, where the books are linked by its recommendations, 
			we have investigated the properties of the network and answered questions such as: 
			does links between a book and its related books end up creating a universe where few 
			books are very influential? Does it keep readers within the same genre? Or maybe no 
			patterns are present?</p>

	<div class="b">
		<p>You sometimes run into books that are simply horrible, but its rating is very high and you start 
			questioning yourself: Does the rating really reflect the readers actual opinion – who knows 
			maybe it’s just a computer program that gives thousands of 5-star ratings to specific books. 
			Under the hypothesis that people’s true opinions are reflected in the comments we have investigated 
			how well the rating reflect people’s opinions. We further investigate if other quantitative measures 
			provide a better estimate of book quality or if you really must sit down and read the comments.</p>

	<h3> About the project </h3>
	<p> On this page you can explore our main findings from investigating how one books is related with the books that 
	are recommended on the books site on Goodreads, an online database of books. We have investigated if 
	the list of recommendations on highly popular books creates a network, where the same book is recommended all the 
	time making them highly influential in the literary society. We have further investigated if books are mainly recommended 
	other books within the same genre, which could limit readers to one sub-category of books. Read about this under the section
	'Network'. </p>
	<p> In addition to investigating the relationsship between books, we have investigated how correlated a books rating is, 
	with the sentiment score of the book reviews. Our hypothesis was that highly rating books have a higher sentiment score in 
	the reviews than a poorly rated book. The network analysis and sentiment analysis is be tied together when investigating 
	whether the influential nodes in the notebook are also some of the books with highest rating/sentiment or if it is something 
	else that drives the high degree nodes. Read about this under the section 'Sentiment'.
		
	<h3> Datasets </h3>
	<p> The information about the books are as mentioned taken from Goodreads. Goodreads is chosen as it holds 
	information about almost every book and therefore creates a good platform to generate uniform data across the 
	list of books. Goodreads further contains reviews of each book, which are crucial for second part of the analysis. </p>
	
	<p> The books chosen are taken from the list <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/264.Books_That_Everyone_Should_Read_At_Least_Once">"Books Everyone Should Read At Least Once"</a> 
	referred to throughout this page as positive books. The list contains 21.618 books (However we have only scraped around 2.000). 
	To create the sentiment analysis we also needed poorly rated books. These we obtained from
	<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/23974.Worst_Rated_Books_on_Goodreads">Worst Rated Books on Goodreads</a>	 
	referred to as negative books. This list contains 416 books. </p>
	
	<p> Due to limited time we have not been able to acquire all the data. Therefore we have limited the number of books, which we 
	have scraped the information on to be 1,917 from the positive list and and all 416 from the negative list. </p>

<div id="Network" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Network</h2>
  <p>We have created a network, where each of the books from the possitive list is a node and where two nodes are connected
	if one books has the other under the section 'Readers also enjoyed'. We have created the network as a directed network.
	This means that a node is only connected to the nodes it recomends - not the nodes that recomends that node.</p> 
	<p> We hereby get a network of 1,917 nodes and 10,001 edges. </p>
	<p> With the network we investigate the degree distribution, which basically means that we investigate how many times each book 
		has been recomended. The node with the highest degree (and thereby is the most recomended) is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
		with degree 535. This means that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is recommended for 25.95% of the books 
		on the list. The average degree is 10.43, and thus it is more than 10 times more likely that harry potter is recommended than
		an average book. </p>
	<p> The figure underneath illustrates the degree distribution for all the books in the positive list. 
		It illustrates that few books have a very large degree while the majority of the books are have a degree under 50. 
		This indicates that there are a few select books that gets recommended for almost every other book on the list. </p>
	
	<h3> Indsæt degree dist figure </h3>
	
	<p> Other than degree, we also have other ways to quantify how influential a node is to the network. We have investigated
		the network with regards to betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality. Betweenness centrality is a meassure 
<		of how many shortest paths passses through a given node. For our network a high betweenness centrality would indicate 
		a gateway book, meaning if you read book A you may not be recommended book B, but you get recommended book C. 
		Book C will then recommend you book B, and the only reason you read book B is therefore because you also read book C. 
		This makes book C very influential. Eigenvector centrality is also an indicator for how influential a node is. 
		A node gets a high score if its neighboring node also have a high score. This would for our network mean that a node
		with a high eigenvector centrality is being recomended by other books that many other books recomend.
		A book with high degree but low eigenvector centrality could therefore be a book that is recommended alot, 
		but these are not them self are recomended very few times. </p>

	<p> Here the network is shown, where the nodesize for each node representing the book is set proportional to the degree, 
		betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality respectively. You can choose which one you want to see by selecting
		each one. If you hover over the illustrations you are able to see what book each node represents - you can also
		zoom in on the images etc. </p>

		<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="Plots/test.html" height="700" width="750"></iframe> 
		<p> 	In this illustration the nodesize is set proportional to each nodes total indegree. This means that the 
			larger the node more frequent the book is recomended. For example we see Harry Potter and the Deathly 
			Hallows has an indegree of 535. </p>
	</div>	
	
	<p> In the table below we see the 10 nodes with highest degree and the corresponding measures. </p>
	<h3> insert table </h3>
	<p> Some interesting remarks can be made from the table above. Looking at entry 8 we see that even though it has 
		a smaller degree than 6 the betweenness centrality meassure is almost 10 times bigger. This indicates that 
		"The Elephant Tree" tends to be recommeneded through fewer iterations than "Watership Down" do. Further, 
		it is noticed that "The Elephant Tree" at enty 8 has a higher eigenvector centrality than all others on the list. 
		This shows that "The Elephant Tree" recommends the popular books more. </p>
	
	<h3> Communities based on genre </h3>
	<p> We have now seen that some books does get recomended much more than the average book and therefore could be classified as 
		highly influential in the literary society. But now lets turn our attention to investigate if the network contains 
		clear groups - in network theory called communities. Our hypothesis was that a book is more likely to be recomended
		by another book if they are in the same genre, and thus each genre would be a small community in the network. </p>
	<p> From the list of books we have 66 different genres. However some of then only consists of 1 book. We have therefore 
		only considered the 15 largest and collected the books in the others in a new genre calles Miscellaneous </p>
	<p> With the genres we have now, we can investigate how well our hyphothesis holds using a modularity score. This is a score 
		ranging from -1 to 1 indicating how well the hypothesized communities, actually are small communities in the network. 
	 	The closer to 1 the better the partition. </p>
	<p> Partitioning on genre the modularity score for the network is <u> 0.53 </u>.  </p>
	<p> This is considered a high score, but to actually tell something about how good partitioning on genre is, you must investigate 
		how well it is possible to partition your network. There are several algorithms that does this. One of them is the louvrain algorithm, 
		which based on the network identifies the best fitting communities. </p>
	<p> The modularity score found by the algorithm is 0.75 (based on 12 communities), which is much higher than when partitioning on
		genre. However as the confusion matrix below illustrates that each genre is almost entirely represented in one community found 
		by the louvain algorithm. </p>
	<h3> indsæt confusion matrix </h3>
	<p> It is therefore true that books are mainly recommended other books within the same genre, and therefore to some extend limits 
		readers to one sub-category of books.</p>

			betweenness centrality).

	<h1> Network of Book Recommendations </h1>
	<div class="a">
		<p><em>Ever finished the greatest book ever and wondered “what’s next?” </em></p>
	</div>

	<div class="b">
		<p>Well sure you have - we all have. And next step could be to simply look at what other readers of your
			"greatest book ever" also read. But how are books related and recommended with each other? This 
			is what we have investigated!</p>
		<p>By creating a network of books, where the books are linked by its recommendations, 
			we have investigated the properties of the network and answered questions such as: 
			does links between a book and its related books end up creating a universe where few 
			books are very influential? Does it keep readers within the same genre? Or maybe no 
			patterns are present?</p>
		<p>
	</div>
	<div class="a">
		<p><em>I’ve only heard bad about this book, but it has a very high rating, how can this be?</em></p>
	</div>

	<div class="b">
		<p>You sometimes run into books that are simply horrible, but its rating is very high and you start 
			questioning yourself: Does the rating really reflect the readers actual opinion – who knows 
			maybe it’s just a computer program that gives thousands of 5-star ratings to specific books. 
			Under the hypothesis that people’s true opinions are reflected in the comments we have investigated 
			how well the rating reflect people’s opinions. We further investigate if other quantitative measures 
			provide a better estimate of book quality or if you really must sit down and read the comments.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="b">
		<p> On this page you can explore our main findings from the investigation on how one book is related with the books that 
	are recommended on Goodreads, an online database of books. 
	Under 'About' you will get a sense of the dataset used for this analysis showing all the descriptive statistics. 
		We have investigated if 
	the list of recommendations creates a network, where the same book is recommended all the 
	time making some books highly influential in the literary society. We have further investigated if books are mainly recommended 
	for other books within the same genre, which could limit readers to one sub-category of books. Read about this under the section
	'Network'. </p>
	<p> In addition to investigating the relationsship between books, we have investigated how correlated a books rating is, 
	with the sentiment score of the book reviews. Our hypothesis was that highly rated books have a higher sentiment score in 
	the reviews than a poorly rated book. The network analysis and sentiment analysis is tied together when investigating 
	whether the most influential books in the network are also some of the books with highest sentiment or if it is something 
	else that drives the high degree nodes. Read about this under the section 'Sentiment'.

	<h3> Datasets </h3>
	<p> The information about the books are as mentioned retrieved from Goodreads. Goodreads is chosen as it holds 
	information about almost every book and therefore creates a good platform to generate uniform data across the 
	list of books. Goodreads further contains reviews of each book, which are crucial for second part of the analysis. </p>
	
	<p> The books chosen are taken from the list <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/264.Books_That_Everyone_Should_Read_At_Least_Once">"Books Everyone Should Read At Least Once"</a> 
	referred to throughout this page as positive books. The list contains 21.618 books (However we have only retrieved around 2.000). 
	To create the sentiment analysis we also needed poorly rated books. These we obtained from
	<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/23974.Worst_Rated_Books_on_Goodreads">Worst Rated Books on Goodreads</a>	 
	referred to as negative books. This list contains 416 books, of which we were able to retrieve 394. </p>

	<p> From all the books scraped we see that the book with the highest rating "Otuna's Flute" with a whopping 5 star
	average rating. The books on the oppostite side of the scale is "Dark Rooms" which has to settle for an 
	average rating of 3.1. Looking at all the books the average rating of the average rating (stick with us here) is 4.01.
	</p>
	
	<p> They ratings do not differ much from book to book, but the number of ratings each book has received is very different.
		The book with the highest rating count is "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" which 6,186,514 people 
		have taken the time to rate. The least rated book is on the other hand "A Debt Free You", that only 12 people 
		shared an opinion about. On average the books in the dataset has a rating count of 200,106.80. 
	</p>
	
	<p> Goodreads also has alot of different genres. The total number of represented genres in our dataset is 66.
		As some of the analysis will be investigting how the book recommend within genre, 66 different classes are bit 
		too much. We have therefore decided to take the largest 15 genres and combine the remaining genres in a combined 
		group called "Miscellaneous". 
	</p>
	
	
	<h3> Disclaimer </h3>
	<p> Due to limited time and limited compute power, the analysis that is the basis for the results presented on this website
	is based on a limited dataset. In the network section 1,978 books are used and only recomendations to other books in this
	list are considered. In the text-analysis section a subset of 450 books from the books used in the network section as well
	as 450 low rated books are used. For each book we have only retrieved 15 reviews. This may affect the results, but
	we will not comment further on this. </p>
</div> 	
	
<!-- ************* Info on Network page ************* --> 
<div id="Network" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Network</h2>
  <p>We have created a network, where each of the books from the positive list is a node and where two nodes are connected
	if one books has the other under the section 'Readers also enjoyed'. We have created the network as a directed network.
	This means that a node is only connected to the nodes it recomends - not the nodes that recomends that node.</p> 
	<p> We hereby get a network of 1,917 nodes and 10,001 edges. </p>
	<p> With the network we investigate the degree distribution, which basically means that we investigate how many times each book 
		has been recomended. The node with the highest degree (and thereby is the most recomended) is "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" 
		with degree 535. This means that "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is recommended for 25.95% of the books 
		on the list. The average degree is 10.43, and thus it is 10 times more likely that Harry Potter is recommended than
		an average book. </p>
	<p> The figure underneath illustrates the degree distribution for all the books in the positive list. 
		It illustrates that few books have a very large degree while the majority of the books have a degree under 50. 
		This indicates that there are a few select books that gets recommended for almost every other book on the list. </p>
	
	<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="Code/Plots/Degree_dist.html" height="700" width=100%></iframe> 
	
	<p> Other than degree, we also have other ways to quantify how influential a node is to the network. We have investigated
		the network with regards to betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality. Betweenness centrality is a meassure 
		of how many shortest paths passses through a given node. For our network a high betweenness centrality would indicate 
		a gateway book, meaning if you read book A you may not be recommended book B, but you get recommended book C. 
		Book C will then recommend you book B, and the only reason you read book B is therefore because you also read book C. 
		This makes book C very influential. Eigenvector centrality is also an indicator for how influential a node is. 
		A node gets a high score if its neighboring node also have a high score. This would for our network mean that a node
		with a high eigenvector centrality is being recomended by other books that many other books recomend.
		A book with high degree but low eigenvector centrality could therefore be a book that is recommended alot, 
		but the books recommending it are not themselves recommended often. </p>

	<p> Here the network is shown, where the nodesize for each node representing the book is set proportional to the degree, 
		betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality respectively. You can choose which one you want to see by selecting
		each one. If you hover over the illustrations you are able to see what book each node represents - you can also
		zoom in on the images etc. </p>

		<p> 	In this illustration the nodesize is set proportional to each nodes total indegree. This means that the 
			larger the node more frequent the book is recomended. For example we see Harry Potter and the Deathly 
			Hallows has an indegree of 535. </p>
	</div>	
	
	<p> In the table below we see the 10 nodes with highest degree and the corresponding measures. </p>
	<h3> insert table </h3>
	<p> A few interesting remarks can be made from the table above. Looking at entry 8 we see that even though it has a 
		smaller degree than entry 6 the betweenness centrality measure is almost 10 times bigger. 
		 <br />This indicates that "The Elephant Tree" tends to be recommended through fewer iterations than 
		"Watership Down" do. Further, it is noticed that "The Elephant Tree" at entry 8 has a higher eigenvector-centrality 
		than all others on the list. This shows that the books that recomends "The Elephant Tree" are them self recomended 
		a lot. </p>
	
	<h3> Communities based on genre </h3>
	<p> We have now seen that some books does get recomended much more than the average book and therefore could be classified as 
		highly influential in the literary society. But now lets turn our attention to investigate if the network contains 
		clear groups - in network theory called communities. Our hypothesis was that a book is more likely to be recomended
		by another book if they are in the same genre, and thus each genre would be a small community in the network. </p>
	<p> From the list of books we have 66 different genres. However as mentionedmany of the genres consists of very few books. 
		We have therefore only considered the 15 largest and collected the books in the others in a new genre called 
		"Miscellaneous". </p>
	<p> With the updated genrelist, we have investigated how well our hyphothesis holds using a modularity score. This is a score 
		ranging from -1 to 1 indicating how well the hypothesized communities, actually are small communities in the network. 
	 	The closer to 1 the better the partition is. </p>
	<p> Partitioning on genre the modularity score for the network is <u> XXX </u>.  </p>
	<p> This is considered a high score, but to actually tell something about how good partitioning on genre is, you must investigate 
		how well it is possible to partition your network. There are several algorithms that does this. One of them is the louvrain algorithm, 
		which based on the network identifies the best fitting communities. </p>
	<p> From the confusion matrix we see that the algorithm does output communities that are consistent with the genres 
		and thus genre seems like a good representative of communities, considering the network. We do, however, see that the 
		modularity score is increased a lot (froom XXX to XXX) when using the Louvrain algorithm, which suggest that some 
		influencial nodes don't represent their genre in the optimal communities.. </p>
	
	<img src="Code/Plots/Confusion_full.png" alt="Confusion matrix (image)" class="smallimage" > 
	
	<p> We remind our self that the network consists nodes with very high degree, which may influence the results heavily, 
		as these most likely are recommended by books from all genres. We investigate if this is the case by considering a subgraph, 
		where the nodes in the top 1 percentile degree are removed. </p>
		
	<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="Code/Plots/G_degree_new.html" height="700" width=90%></iframe> 
	
	<p> On this network it is very clear to se that there are communities based on genre, which is supported by an 
		increased modularity. To say that books generally recommends books within the same genre and therefore to 
		some extend limits readers within a sub-category, is not wrong. </p>

  <h2>Text Analysis</h2>
  <p>On Goodreads users are able to write reviews on the books and many do. We have investigated these rewievs using sentiment
	  analysis and further investigated the word prevalence of those classified as very positive and very negative 
	  respectively. Comparing each books sentiment score with the ratings we have investigated how well these match. </p>
	<p> In the text analysis, we have included the books from the negative book list. The analysis therefore consists of books
		both with very high average rating and very low average rating. <p>
	<h4> Sentiment </h4>
	Sentiment in text is the amount of emotion portrayed. Two methods can be used to calculate the sentiment of a text: 
		a model can be trained on positive and negative data to learn nuances differentiating the two, or a rule-based approach
		can be used, where sentiment of a text is the result of a set of manually set rules. 
		Often it is the rule-based approach that is used, as building a model to score automatically is both 
		time-consuming and requires excessive amounts of data. 
		The rule-based approach utilizes many Natural Language Processing methods such as tokenizing, stemming and 
		part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The polarization of words is often the result of a look-up in a predefined 
		lexical with polarity scores for certain words.
		For this project we have used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner) sentiment package 
		in Python. The VADER library is a rule-based approach especially appropriate for text from social media. 
		It is a highly sophisticated package which takes the syntax of the sentence into account when scoring and 
		thereby avoiding a common fall-back of the classical lexical approach, such as the incorporations of negations.
		Further, VADER has a sense of capitalization making words such as "GREAT" score higher than "great" as well as
		a sense of punctuation, letting multiple exclamation marks give a higher polarity score. 
		The package is tuned for sentence-based sentiment but will for this purpose be used on full reviews 
		for a single book some spanning several paragraphs. The final sentiment for the book is then the mean of the
		sentiment of the reviews for the book. 

		The output from the VADER analysis is a negative, neutral, positive and compound score, where the compound 
		score is the overall sentiment of the sentence and what is used in this analysis. The scores can range 
		between -1 to 1 with 1 being the most positive and -1 the most negative. 
	
	<p> Below you see the distribution of the sentiment score for the books from the postive and negative list respectively.
	</p>
	
	<img src="Code/Plots/Sentimentscores.png" alt="Sentiment distributions" class="smallimage"> 
	
	<p> As expected we see that the books from the negative list generally scores lower than the books from the positive 
		list. However, from the illustration we also see that some books from the negative list scores worse than the 
		average 'bad' book, and some of the books from the positive list scores higher than the average 'good' book. </p>
	<p> We therefore introduce two new groupd, where books are classified as very negative and very positive as
		the books that scored below the 5<sub>th</sub> 
		percentile and above the 95<sub>th</sub> percentile respectively of the combined sentiment scores for all books.</p>
	<p> With the information retrieval method, TD-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) we have investigated the 
		word prevalence for the very negative and very positive books. The TD-IDF score is calculated as the frequency
		a word is present in a document (here all the reviews in one group) adjusted with how used the word is across all
		documents in corpus. The results are respresented in the wordclouds below. </p>
	<div class="cont2"
		<div class="row">
			<div class="column" id="img1">
					<img src="Code/Plots/Wordcloud_pospos.png" alt="Wordcloud for very positive books" class="image"> 
					<div class="overlay">Very positive books</div>
			</div>
			<div class="column" id="img2">
					<img src="Code/Plots/Wordcloud_negneg.png" alt="Wordcloud for very negative books" class="image"> 
					<div class="overlay">Very negative books</div>
			</div>
		</div>	
	</div>
	
	<p> These wordclouds does not display the 
		clear sentiment that was hypothesized. They become rather book specific with "Abbey" prominent for the 
		positive books most likely referring to a character or author, and "Miller" in the negative books also 
		probably a character or author. 
		Further, one of the main words in the wordcloud of good books is "lonesome". Investigating the reviews where 
		this is present a bit further shows, that it is used when describing a scene or character in one of the books. 
		The wordcloud for the negative books does catch some general trends especially in the books from the negative 
		list. 
		Here words such as "trans", "raped", "killer", "racial" and "blacks" appear. A quick glance at the title of 
		the books on the negative list largely contributing to the final negative list, reveals quite unique takes 
		on some of these topics. 
	</p>
	
	<p> Having scored all the books it is then also possible to find the book with the highest sentiment score. This turns
		out to be "Goodnight Moon" by Margaret Wise Brown where all the 15 reviews gathered for this book is higher 
		than 0.9. An example of one of the reviews for "Goodnight Moon" is seen below. 
	</p>
	<div class="a">
		<p><em>'Loved it from page 1. Slow paced and really descriptive but I loved it. 
			I really enjoyed learning about life back then for the Nolans. Highs and lows of life
			and daily experience I was so emotionally attached to Francie. 
			She was a brillant character and I loved her to pieces' </em></p>
	</div>
	
	<p> Similarly the book with the lowest sentiment score was found. This was "Revealing Eden" by Victoria Foyt and
		one of the reviews gotten for that book is seen below. 
	</p>
	
	<div class="a">
		<p><em>"This is a terrible idea for a book. As a woman of color, I find it extremely offensive
			to see a woman in blackface on the promotion, a comparison to Beauty and the Beast, where
			a black man is considered 'beastly', and the names of the two races themselves - 'pearl' 
			for white and 'coal' for black - what is this author trying to convey here? I'm sure anyone 
			with a brain can guess. As a young adult, my intelligence is insulted - how could this be 
			considered good literature when it blatantly trivializes the trials and tribulations 
			of actual slavery? It can't - this book is absolute trash. " </em></p>
	</div>
	
	<p> This concludes the major investigations of sentiment in the reviews. The extreme cases of sentiment catch
		reviews that are highly polar but creating TFIDF conditioned on overall sentiment did not appear to give 
		useful divisions of the two groups. 
		The hypothesis was that calculating the TFIDF of the positively scored books would highlight 
		very positive words, as these are more likely in that group. The conclusion is though, that the words 
		caught by the TFIDF seem to be more differentiated than that. 
	</p>
	<p> The general idea was that using sentiment analysis the rating of a books could be somewhat predicted, as 
		sentiment analysis on other kind of reviews have proven very effective. Our results could indicate that 
		this approach is made difficult when the object of the review is text as well. In this case the reviews 
		often contain quotes are descriptions of the books, and if the book itself carry a low sentiment, the 
		review will score likewise even though the reviewer expressed a positive opinion about the books. 
	</p>
	<p> To see whether there is a relationsship between the sentiment score and the rating of a book the two are plotted
		against each other. If a linear line trend is seen, it would indicate that a high rating gives a high sentiment
		score. The plot is seen below.

	<p> Here a small positive correlation is seen but a clear relationsship between sentiment and rating does not seem
		to be present.

<!-- ************* Info on Summary page ************* -->
<div id="Summary" class="tabcontent">
	<h1> Summary </h1>
	<p> Throughout this project a network of books has been explored. Looking at books from a list of very popular books 
		a network was created as a link between two books if one book was recommended on the other books Goodreads page.
	<br/> The resulting network showed that few books have very large degree and are therefore recommended often by others. 
		Investigating the network with betweenness-centrality equally showed that some books seem very influential. 
		The eigenvector-centrality scores though contradicted this. However, it still seems clear that some books in 
		the network are very influential. 
	<br/>The next approach to investigating the network we used was community detection. One hypothesis was that books 
		recommend books within the same genre. Here it was seen that when communities were partitioned on genre in the 
		full graph did indicate our hypothesis was true, but it also indicated that some very influential nodes don't 
		represent their genre in the optimal communities. We therefore created a sub-graph, where the nodes in the top 
		1 percentile degree was removed. This even further indicated that books do tend to recommend books within the 
		same genre more than books of different genres. </p>

	<p> Next, the reviews of each book were taken into account. To get two groups to compare, books from a very poorly 
		rated list of books was also scraped. First, a TFIDF analysis was performed between two documents; one with 
		all the tokens from the reviews on the positive list, and one with the tokens from the reviews on the negative 
		list. 
	<br/> The result was illustrated using word clouds. The intuition was, that were more prominent in the positive list 
		than the negative list would be very positive words and opposite for words originating from the negative list. 
		This was not the case. Instead, the analysis seemed to pick up on highly book specific words indicating that 
		descriptive polar words where present in both documents. 
	<br/> Since the two groups differed as being highly rated versus low rated books, a clear distinction on sentiment in 
		the reviews was also expected. Finding the sentiment of each reviews and meaning over the 15 reviews acquired 
		for each book did show a separation of distribution of sentiment for the two groups. 
	<br/> It did also indicate overlapping sentiment, meaning that some books from the positive list scored a rather 
		negative sentiment and some books from the negative list scored positively. 
	<br/> This led to the creation of two new groups, where a threshold for high and low sentiment respectively was set, 
		and all books regardless of origin scoring above or below these thresholds were classified as either positive 
		book or negative book. 
	<br/>Diving into the most positive and negative rated books and investigating their sentiment in reviews showed that the 
		sentiment analysis had in fact managed to pick up the general sentiment of a review. A TFIDF analysis was once 
		more performed on this division of books, and a better intuitive wordclouds appeared. They were though still very 
		book specific and some of the highest scoring words referred to specific authors or characters. </p>

	<p> Lastly, an investigation of correlations between some of the parameters was performed. This indicated a slight 
		positive correlation between the rating of a book and the sentiment score of their reviews. It was though not 
		as prevalent as first hypothesized. 
	<br/> No correlation was found between the degree and the sentiment of the reviews for a book, dismissing the idea that 
		if a book is recommended often, then the sentiment in the reviews is also high. 
	<br/>Last correlation investigated was a correlation between rating and the logarithm of the rating count. Here a 
		clear positive correlation was seen indicating a high rating count gives a high rating. The data is though 
		biased since the books chosen are very popular books conditioning them to have both a higher rating and a higher 
		rating count. </p>

	<p> Overall, the analysis performed in this project showed, that few books are recommended often, making them very 
		influential in the literary society. Books recommended by these books therefore hold a higher influence themselves.
		Further, it was showed that TFIDF and sentiment analysis on reviews of books, was skewed by the fact that the 
		reviews themselves often contain quotes or descriptions of the book reviewed. </p>
